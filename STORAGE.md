I have **27 TB** of storage to store my media plus my VPS offers 200 GB out of which only 150 GB remains. The MLTB bot is currently using the 150 GB space.

# My storage options:
- Onedrive (25 TB)
- Google Drive (2 TB)

> For these storage I am paying 1000 INR a year (don't ask me how, I won't tell).
